This script demonstrates basic variable assignments and arithmetic operations in Python.
It includes examples of printing variable values, performing addition, subtraction, division,
multiplication, and exponentiation.

# Assigning string value to the variable 'name'
name = "Rehan"

# Assigning integer value to the variable 'age'
age = 21

# Assigning boolean value to the variable 'isMarried'
isMarried = True

# Printing the values of the variables
print(name)
print(age)
print(isMarried)

# The following block of code is commented out.
# It takes two numbers as input from the user, but is currently inactive.

# first_number = int(input("Enter first number: "))
# # first_number = int(first_number)
# second_number = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Assigning predefined values to the variables for arithmetic operations
first_number = 5
second_number = 10

# Calculating the sum of 'first_number' and 'second_number'
sum = first_number + second_number
# Printing the result of the addition
print("Sum is: ", sum)

# Reassigning new values to the variables for further arithmetic operations
first_number = 50
second_number = 24

# Calculating the difference between 'first_number' and 'second_number'
sub = first_number - second_number
# Printing the result of the subtraction
print("Sub is: ", sub)

# Calculating the division of 'first_number' by 'second_number'
div = first_number / second_number

# Calculating the multiplication of 'first_number' and 'second_number'
mul = first_number * second_number

# Calculating the exponentiation of 'first_number' to the power of 'second_number'
pow = first_number ** second_number


# The results of the division, multiplication, and exponentiation are calculated but not printed.
