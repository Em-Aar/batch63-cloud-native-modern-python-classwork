# CLASS-03 SUMMARY

## Variables in Python

We have learnt different data types in Python. When we write a python program, we have to provide data in it. But we have to declare variables to store the data in it.

**Let's take a real world example which will help us to understand variables in python.**

We all have seen libraries where hundreds and thousands of books are available. If we want to read any book, we have to search for it. To search a book, we take help of the labels. Imagine if books/racks are not labeled, how we can search a particular book among hundred of thousands of book in the library. It will take a lot of time.

Just like labels help us to identify specific books, variables help us to store and identify specific data in our Python programs. For example, we can use a variable named `student_name` to store the name of a students, `quarter` to current quarter of the student and `student_emails` to store the emails of the students.

```python
student_name = "Musa Abdullah"
quarter = "q1"
student_email = "musa@example.com"]
```

By using these variables, we can easily manipulate and access the student information without remembering the actual data. This makes our Python programs more organized, efficient, and easier to understand.

**So what we understood is that**

- A variable is like a label that points to a specific location in the computer's memory where data is stored.
- Variables are named storage locations for data.
- They make code more readable and maintainable.
- The data stored in a variable can be changed.

## Operators in Python

### 1. Arithematic Operators

1- `+` Adding two numbers, or joining two strings

2- `-` Subtracting two numbers

3- `*` Multiplying two numbers

4- `/` Dividing two numbers

5- `**` Power of two numbers

6- `%` Modulus of two numbers

7- `//` Floor division of two numbers

\*For assignment "Create a Calculator" that takes two numbers as input, use this docker command to run the container `docker run -it your_image_name`
